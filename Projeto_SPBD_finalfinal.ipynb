        "Consider the graph where locations/zones (vertices) are connected by the taxi rides (edges). Locations that have many incoming rides, ie., those that are the dropoff location for many rides, will tend to be important hubs (centers of activity) in the city. Use Pagerank to find these hubs.\n",
        "\n",
        "To that end, to simplify the graph, do not consider rides that involve \"Unknown\" zones. Additionally, for each zone, only consider the rides that start in that zone and end in the top-5 destinations for that zone (This will remove the edges corresponding to (src-dst) zone pairs that are not very popular).\n",

        "In order to find the most important zones of the city, according to the defined criteria, we start by filtering our DataFrame, eliminating the rows where either \"PULocationID\", \"DOLocationID\" or both have the IDs 264 or 265, as those are the codes corresponding to \"Unknown\" zones.\n",
        "\n",
        "Next, we have to define our vertices. This involves selecting the relevant columns - the pick-up and drop-off location IDs (\"PULocationID\", \"DOLocationID\") from the filtered DataFrame.\n",
        "\n",
        "After this, we need to obtain the top-5 destinations (\"DOLocationID\") for each pick-up zone (\"PULocationID\"). To do this, we defined a window specification to rank the drop-off locations based on the number of rides originating from each pick-up zone. Using this window specification, we then computed the top-5 destinations for each zone and created a DataFrame containing these high-frequency destinations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Subsequently, we created our edges. To that aim, we filtered them using the top-destinations DataFrame, ensuring that only edges connecting zones with high-frequency destinations are retained. We also renamed the columns \"PULocationID\" and \"DOLocationID\" to \"src\" and \"dst,\" respectively, conforming to the GraphFrame API convention.\n",
        "\n",
        "Following this, we created a GraphFrame object using the filtered vertices and edges DataFrames.\n",
        "\n",
        "Afterwards, we applied the PageRank algorithm to the GraphFrame, setting the reset probability to 0.15 (as is used in the original PageRank algorithm) and the maximum number of iterations to 50 (to set a cap if no convergence has been reach by that iteration).\n",
        "\n",
        "Then, we retrieved our results, sorting them in descending order according to the PageRank score of each location. Seen as the locations in our original data (rides) are only represented by their respective \"LocationID\", and that data for correspondence to actual city boroughs and zones was actually available in a separate .csv file, we aggregated this information to our results, to make them more interpretable.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, we also ranked the NYC Boroughs according to the computed mean PageRank of each borough (taking into account the number of LocationIDs that each borough encompasses) to also understand which boroughs are more important."
